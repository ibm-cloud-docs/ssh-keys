# Getting started with SSH keys
{: #getting-started-tutorial}

You can add, manage, and delete SSH keys on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Classic infrastructure by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console.
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin-ssh-keys}

1. Learn more about [SSH keys](/docs/infrastructure/ssh-keys?topic=ssh-keys-about-ssh-keys).
2. Makre sure that you have the necessary account permissions and device access so you can view and manage SSH keys. Only the account owner, or a user with the **Manage Users** classic infrastructure permission, can adjust the permissions. For more information about permissions, see [Classic infrastructure permissions](/docs/iam?topic=iam-infrapermission#infrapermission) and [Managing device access](/docs/vsi?topic=virtual-servers-managing-device-access).

## Next steps
{: #next-steps-getting-started-ssh-keys}

After you make sure that you have the right access to view and manage SSH keys, you can [add SSH keys](/docs/infrastructure/ssh-keys?topic=ssh-keys-adding-an-ssh-key#adding-an-ssh-key), [edit labels and notes](/docs/infrastructure/ssh-keys?topic=ssh-keys-editing-details-for-an-ssh-key#editing-details-for-an-ssh-key), and [remove SSH keys](/docs/infrastructure/ssh-keys?topic=ssh-keys-removing-an-ssh-key#removing-an-ssh-key). No more than 100 SSH keys can be associated with an account at any time.
