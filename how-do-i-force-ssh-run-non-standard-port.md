# Configuring SSH to run on a nonstandard port
{: #configuring-ssh-to-run-on-a-non-standard-port}

Use the following steps to force SSH to run on a nonstandard port.

1. Open `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` in a text editor. The following example is for vi editor.

   ```text
   # vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Go to the following line:

   _# Port 22_

3. Uncomment and edit this line to reflect the new port. You can set this port to any nonstandard port.

   ```text
   Port 2255
   ```
   {: pre}

4. Save and quit the file, and restart SSH.

   ```text
   # /etc/init.d/sshd restart
   ```
   {: pre}

5. If you are connected to the server by using SSH on port 22, you need to reconnect by using the new port.
