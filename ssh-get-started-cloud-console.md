# Getting started with SSH keys for IBM Cloud Console and VPC (Beta)

When you provision a virtual server instance through the beta offering, you can select an existing SSH key, or add a new SSH key. During the 
beta, you cannot generate SSH keys.

You can also view and manage SSH keys from the SSH Keys page:
1. In IBM Cloud Console, navigate to **Infrastructure > Compute > SSH Keys**. 
2. From this page, you can edit and delete SSH keys, or add a new SSH Key.
